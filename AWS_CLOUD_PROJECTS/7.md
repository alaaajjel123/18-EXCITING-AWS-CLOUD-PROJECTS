# AWS Aurora with PHP Web Application on EC2

This project demonstrates a robust and professional integration of Amazon Aurora with a PHP web application hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. The setup showcases the high availability and scalability features of Amazon Aurora, along with a practical example of connecting a web application to a relational database. This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up, testing, and cleaning up the environment.

## Overview

- **Amazon Aurora**: A MySQL-compatible relational database that combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases.
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud, allowing you to deploy and run applications.
- **PHP Application**: A simple web application that connects to the Aurora database to log and display page visits.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of PHP, MySQL, and Linux commands

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Launch EC2 Instance

1. Navigate to the EC2 console.
2. Click on **"Launch Instance"**.
3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (e.g., **Amazon Linux 2**).
4. Select an instance type (e.g., **t2.micro**).
5. Create a new key pair (**aurora-demo-instance-key-pair**) and download it.
6. Configure network settings to allow **HTTP traffic**.
7. Click **"Launch"**.

### 2. Create Amazon Aurora Database Cluster

1. Navigate to the **RDS console**.
2. Click on **"Create database"**.
3. Choose **"Standard create"** and select **"Amazon Aurora"** as the engine type.
4. Choose the **MySQL-compatible edition**.
5. Configure the database settings:
   - **DB cluster identifier**: `aurora-demo-cluster`
   - **Master username**: `admin`
   - **Master password**: `admin123`
   - **DB instance class**: Choose an appropriate instance class.
   - **Storage**: Configure as needed.
6. Set up connectivity:
   - Choose the **VPC and subnet group**.
   - Enable **public access** if required.
7. Click **"Create database"**.

### 3. Connect to EC2 Instance

SSH into your EC2 instance using the key pair:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/aurora-demo-instance-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
```

Update the instance and install Apache, PHP, and MySQL client:

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install -y httpd php php-mysqlnd mariadb105
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

### 4. Configure PHP Application

Set environment variables for database connection:

```bash
export USERNAME=admin
export PASSWORD=admin123
export DATABASE=myapp
export SERVERNAME=<aurora-cluster-endpoint>
```

Create a PHP file to connect to the Aurora database:

```bash
sudo tee /var/www/html/index.php > /dev/null << EOL
<?php
$servername = "${SERVERNAME}";
$username = "${USERNAME}";
$password = "${PASSWORD}";
$dbname = "${DATABASE}";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully to Aurora database!<br>";

// Create table if not exists
$sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS visits (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    visit_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)";
$conn->query($sql);

// Insert new visit
$sql = "INSERT INTO visits (visit_time) VALUES (NOW())";
$conn->query($sql);

// Get visit count
$sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM visits";
$result = $conn->query($sql);
$row = $result->fetch_assoc();
$count = $row['count'];

echo "This page has been visited {$count} times.";

$conn->close();
?>
EOL
```

Restart the Apache server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

### 5. Test the Setup

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the **public IP** of your EC2 instance.
2. You should see a message indicating a successful connection to the Aurora database and the number of page visits.

### 6. Explore Aurora Features

- Add a **read replica** to the Aurora cluster to explore high availability and read scalability.
- Test **failover scenarios** to ensure high availability.

## 7. Clean Up

### Delete Aurora Database Cluster:

1. Navigate to the **RDS console**.
2. Select the **aurora-demo-cluster**.
3. Click **"Delete"**.

### Terminate EC2 Instance:

1. Navigate to the **EC2 console**.
2. Select the **aurora-demo-instance**.
3. Click **"Terminate"**.

### Delete Key Pair:

1. Navigate to the **EC2 console**.
2. Select **"Key Pairs"**.
3. Delete the **aurora-demo-instance-key-pair**.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a powerful and professional integration of Amazon Aurora with a PHP web application on EC2. By following this guide, you have showcased advanced technical skills in deploying and managing scalable, high-availability database solutions in the AWS Cloud. This setup can be extended for various applications, including e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and more.
