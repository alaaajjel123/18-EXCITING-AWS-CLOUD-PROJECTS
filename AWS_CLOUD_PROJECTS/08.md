# Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda Integration

This project demonstrates a robust and professional integration of Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda. The setup allows you to create a REST API that triggers a Lambda function, showcasing the seamless interaction between these AWS services. This README provides a detailed guide to setting up, testing, and cleaning up the environment.

## Overview

- **Amazon API Gateway**: A fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
- **AWS Lambda**: A serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources.
- **REST API**: An API that uses HTTP requests to interact with resources, enabling communication between the client and server.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs and serverless architecture

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Lambda Function

1. Navigate to the **Lambda console**.
2. Click on **"Create function"**.
3. Choose **"Author from scratch"**.
4. Enter a name for your function (e.g., `HelloWorldFunction`).
5. Choose **Python 3.x** as the runtime.
6. Click **"Create function"**.
7. Replace the existing code with the following:

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Log the incoming event
    print("Received event: " + json.dumps(event, indent=2))
    
    # Return a response
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')
    }
```

8. Click **"Deploy"** to save the changes.

### 2. Create an API Gateway REST API

1. Navigate to the **API Gateway console**.
2. Click on **"Create API"**.
3. Choose **"REST API"** and click **"Build"**.
4. Enter a name for your API (e.g., `HelloWorldAPI`).
5. Click **"Create API"**.

### 3. Create a Resource and Method

1. In the **API Gateway console**, select your API.
2. Click on **"Actions"** and choose **"Create Resource"**.
3. Enter a resource name (e.g., `hello`).
4. Click **"Create Resource"**.
5. With the new resource selected, click on **"Actions"** and choose **"Create Method"**.
6. Select **GET** from the dropdown and click the checkmark.

### 4. Integrate the API Method with Lambda

1. In the method setup, choose **"Lambda Function"** as the integration type.
2. Select the **region** where your Lambda function is deployed.
3. Enter the name of your Lambda function (`HelloWorldFunction`).
4. Click **"Save"**.
5. When prompted to add permissions, click **"OK"**.

### 5. Deploy the API

1. Click on **"Actions"** and choose **"Deploy API"**.
2. Create a new deployment stage (e.g., `prod`).
3. Click **"Deploy"**.

### 6. Test the API

1. After deployment, you will be provided with an **Invoke URL**.
2. Copy the URL and append `/hello` to it.
3. Paste the URL into a web browser or use a tool like **Postman** to send a GET request.
4. You should receive a response: **"Hello from Lambda!"**.

## Clean Up

### Delete API:

1. Navigate to the **API Gateway console**.
2. Select your API (`HelloWorldAPI`).
3. Click on **"Actions"** and choose **"Delete"**.

### Delete Lambda Function:

1. Navigate to the **Lambda console**.
2. Select your function (`HelloWorldFunction`).
3. Click **"Delete"**.

### Delete IAM Role:

1. Navigate to the **IAM console**.
2. Select the role created for the Lambda function.
3. Click **"Delete role"**.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a powerful and professional integration of Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda. By following this guide, you have showcased advanced technical skills in creating, deploying, and managing REST APIs in a serverless environment.
