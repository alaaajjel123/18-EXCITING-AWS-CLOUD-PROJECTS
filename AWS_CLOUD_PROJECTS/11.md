# Amazon CloudFront with S3 Integration

This project demonstrates a robust and professional setup of Amazon CloudFront integrated with an S3 bucket to serve content globally with low latency and high transfer speeds. The setup includes creating a CloudFront distribution, configuring S3 bucket policies, and testing the distribution. This README provides a detailed guide to setting up, testing, and cleaning up the environment.

## Overview
- **Amazon S3**: Provides scalable storage for static content.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: A content delivery network (CDN) that delivers content to users with low latency and high transfer speeds.
- **Static Website Hosting**: Serve static HTML content through CloudFront.

## General Design Solution:

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of S3, CloudFront, and HTML

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket and Upload a Sample HTML File
1. Navigate to the S3 console.
2. Click on "Create bucket".
3. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-cloudfront-demo-bucket-567444`).
4. Choose the region and configure settings as needed.
5. Click "Create bucket".

Create an `index.html` file with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>CloudFront Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello from CloudFront!</h1>
    <p>This content is being served through Amazon CloudFront.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Upload the `index.html` file to the S3 bucket.

### 2. Create a CloudFront Distribution
1. Navigate to the CloudFront console.
2. Click on "Create distribution".
3. Choose "Web" as the delivery method.
4. Configure the origin:
   - **Origin domain**: Select your S3 bucket (`my-cloudfront-demo-bucket-567444.s3.amazonaws.com`).
   - **Origin access**: Create a new Origin Access Control (OAC).
5. Configure default cache behavior settings.
6. Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF) if required.
7. Click "Create distribution".

### 3. Configure the S3 Bucket Policy
1. Navigate to the S3 console.
2. Select your bucket (`my-cloudfront-demo-bucket-567444`).
3. Go to the "Permissions" tab.
4. Edit the bucket policy and paste the following policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-cloudfront-demo-bucket-567444/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::651623850282:distribution/E1P8MNW9G4879Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Save the changes.

### 4. Test the CloudFront Distribution
1. Once the CloudFront distribution is deployed, copy the distribution URL.
2. Append `/index.html` to the URL and paste it into a web browser.
3. You should see the content of your `index.html` file served through CloudFront.

### 5. Enable Additional CloudFront Features
- Explore additional CloudFront features such as cache behavior settings, geo-restrictions, and custom SSL certificates.
- Configure these settings as needed for your use case.

## Clean Up

### Disable the CloudFront Distribution:
1. Navigate to the CloudFront console.
2. Select your distribution.
3. Click "Disable".

### Delete the CloudFront Distribution:
1. Wait for the distribution to be fully disabled.
2. Click "Delete".

### Empty the S3 Bucket:
1. Navigate to the S3 console.
2. Select your bucket (`my-cloudfront-demo-bucket-567444`).
3. Click "Empty bucket".

### Delete the S3 Bucket:
1. Navigate to the S3 console.
2. Select your bucket (`my-cloudfront-demo-bucket-567444`).
3. Click "Delete".
