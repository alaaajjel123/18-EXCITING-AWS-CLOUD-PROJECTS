# Amazon CloudWatch with EC2 and SNS Integration

This project demonstrates a robust and professional setup of Amazon CloudWatch to monitor EC2 instance performance and trigger alerts via Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). The setup ensures proactive monitoring and notification of high CPU utilization, showcasing the power of AWS monitoring and alerting services. This README provides a detailed guide to setting up, testing, and cleaning up the environment.

## Overview
- **Amazon EC2**: Provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors resources and applications in real-time.
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends notifications via email or other protocols when alarms are triggered.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of EC2, CloudWatch, and SNS

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create an EC2 Instance
1. Navigate to the EC2 console.
2. Click on **"Launch Instance"**.
3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) (e.g., **Amazon Linux 2**).
4. Select an instance type (e.g., **t2.micro**).
5. Create a new key pair (**cloudwatch-demo-key-pair**) and download it.
6. Configure network settings to allow SSH access.
7. Launch the instance.

### 2. Create an SNS Topic
1. Navigate to the SNS console.
2. Click on **"Create topic"**.
3. Enter a name for your topic (e.g., **EC2-CPU-Alarm**).
4. Click **"Create topic"**.
5. **Create a subscription**:
   - Select the topic you just created.
   - Click on **"Create subscription"**.
   - Choose **"Email"** as the protocol.
   - Enter the email address you want to subscribe.
   - Click **"Create subscription"**.
6. Confirm the subscription by clicking the link in the confirmation email.

### 3. Create a CloudWatch Alarm
1. Navigate to the CloudWatch console.
2. Click on **"Alarms"** and then **"Create alarm"**.
3. Select the metric for your EC2 instance (e.g., **CPUUtilization**).
4. Set the conditions for the alarm:
   - **Threshold type**: Static
   - **Whenever CPUUtilization is > 80**
5. **Configure actions**:
   - Select **"Send a notification to an SNS topic"**.
   - Choose the SNS topic you created (**EC2-CPU-Alarm**).
6. Enter an alarm name (e.g., **High CPU Utilization Alert**).
7. Click **"Create alarm"**.

### 4. Connect to EC2 Instance and Install Stress Tool
1. SSH into your EC2 instance using the key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh -i /path/to/cloudwatch-demo-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
   ```
2. Install the stress tool to simulate high CPU utilization:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y stress
   ```
3. Run the stress tool to increase CPU usage:
   ```bash
   stress --cpu 1 --timeout 600
   ```

### 5. Monitor and Test the Setup
- Monitor the **CloudWatch console** to see the alarm state change to **"In Alarm"**.
- Check your email for the notification sent by SNS.

## Clean Up

### Terminate EC2 Instance:
1. Navigate to the EC2 console.
2. Select the instance (**cloudwatch-demo**).
3. Click **"Terminate"**.

### Delete SNS Topic:
1. Navigate to the SNS console.
2. Select the topic (**EC2-CPU-Alarm**).
3. Click **"Delete"**.

### Delete SNS Subscription:
1. Navigate to the SNS console.
2. Select the subscription.
3. Click **"Delete"**.

### Delete CloudWatch Alarm:
1. Navigate to the CloudWatch console.
2. Select the alarm (**High CPU Utilization Alert**).
3. Click **"Delete"**.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a powerful and professional setup of Amazon CloudWatch integrated with EC2 and SNS. By following this guide, you have showcased advanced technical skills in monitoring, alerting, and managing AWS resources effectively. This setup can be extended for various applications, including performance monitoring, resource optimization, and incident management.
